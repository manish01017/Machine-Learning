    "# Lemmatization and Part of Speech (POS) Tagging\n",
    "\n",
    "Lemmatization is an advanced text normalization technique that converts words to their base form (lemma) using morphological analysis and part of speech (POS). Unlike stemming, which simply truncates words, lemmatization considers word context to determine the correct base form.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features\n",
    "- Uses POS tags (NOUN, VERB, ADJ, ADV) to determine correct lemma\n",
    "- Produces valid dictionary words (unlike stemming)\n",
    "- Example: \"better\" → \"good\" (as ADJ) or \"well\" (as ADV)\n",
    "- \"running\" → \"run\", \"was\" → \"be\", \"studies\" → \"study\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits vs. Stemming\n",
    "- More accurate word reduction\n",
    "- Maintains semantic meaning\n",
    "- Better for NLP tasks like text analysis, classification, and translation\n",
    "- **Slower but produces meaningful results (stems can be nonsensical)**\n",

    "# Part of Speech (POS) in Lemmatization\n",
    "\n",
    "POS tagging is crucial for accurate lemmatization as the same word can have different lemmas based on its part of speech.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common POS Tags\n",
    "- `NOUN`: Objects, concepts (e.g., dog, happiness)\n",
    "- `VERB`: Actions, states (e.g., run, be)\n",
    "- `ADJ`: Descriptive words (e.g., happy, large)\n",
    "- `ADV`: Modifies verbs/adjectives (e.g., quickly, very)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why POS Matters in Lemmatization\n",
    "Consider the word \"better\":\n",
    "- As an ADJ → lemmatizes to \"good\"\n",
    "- As an ADV → lemmatizes to \"well\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"He is better\" (ADJ) → \"He is good\"\n",
    "\"He performs better\" (ADV) → \"He performs well\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This context-aware approach makes lemmatization more accurate than stemming, which would treat \"better\" the same way regardless of its use in the sentence."
