Bag of Words vs One-Hot Encoding in NLP

Advantages of Bag of Words:
- Simple and easy to implement
- Captures word frequency, useful for text classification
- fixed size I/p feature 
- Binary BOW - gives only 1 to the selected words 

Disadvantages of Bag of Words:
- Ignores word order and context - since ordering is changed ,meaning changes
- Results in high-dimensional sparse vectors (Sparse matrix)
- Cannot capture semantic meaning or relationships
- Sensitive to vocabulary size and noise (OOV)

Advantages of One-Hot Encoding:
- Simple representation for categorical data
- Useful for small, fixed vocabularies
- No ambiguity in word representation

Disadvantages of One-Hot Encoding:
- Sparse Matrix-- leads to overfitting
- Each word is independent (no semantic similarity)
- Does not capture word frequency or order
- OOV ( Out of vocabulary) - won't be able to handle any new words
- different zize of input
